# Sentiment-Analysis-From-Text
Sentiment Analysis from Text is a Python-based machine learning project that predicts the sentiment of textual messages using two powerful algorithms - Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. The project aims to provide valuable insights into the emotional tone of messages. It finds applications in social media sentiment tracking, customer feedback analysis, and more.

To optimize the program's speed and make predictions faster, the trained models were saved in .pkl (pickle) files. This way, the program no longer needs to recompile the models for every prediction, resulting in significantly reduced prediction time.

# Difficulties
### Data Cleaning
  The dataset obtained from Kaggle was not clean, requiring extensive data cleaning and preprocessing. Addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies was essential to improve model performance.

### Feature Extraction
   Identifying relevant features from the text data was important for the project. Extracting useful information and transforming it into a suitable format for the algorithms required lots of attention.

### Low Initial Accuracy
  Achieving satisfactory accuracy at the beginning was challenging due to the absence of fine-tuned models.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
  Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models played a critical role in achieving higher accuracy.

### Prediction Time
  Model's training and prediction was taking too much time, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Implementing model serialization by saving the trained models as .pkl files drastically improved prediction speed.
